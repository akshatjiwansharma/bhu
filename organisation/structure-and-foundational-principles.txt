Organisational structure 

bhū decentralized, non-profit collective dedicated to uniting individuals and groups worldwide around a shared set of founding principles. Operating without formal registration, bhū fosters a global network of autonomous members and sub-councils who collaborate to facilitate trade and mutual support while adhering to a core ethos of trust, autonomy, and purpose-driven action.

bhū exists to bind its members to universal principles that promote ethical collaboration and innovation. It operates as a non-financial entity, neither handling money nor seeking donations or tax exemptions. Members manage their own finances and retain any income earned, ensuring self-sufficiency. The organization facilitates trade by connecting members for business and knowledge-sharing opportunities, without generating organizational revenue.

bhū’s structure balances centralized purpose with decentralized action. A central committee oversees member admissions to ensure alignment with founding principles, while members and sub-councils operate autonomously, guided by their own tailored principles that harmonize with the core. Non-binding Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) outline collaborative expectations, and disputes are resolved through informal arbitration, emphasizing trust and internal resolution.

Designed for global scalability, bhū operates without ties to any single jurisdiction, allowing rapid expansion across diverse cultural and economic contexts. Credibility is built through personal connections, leveraging respected members’ networks and demonstrated successes in trade facilitation. 

  
bhū aims to create a flexible, adaptive network that grows organically while maintaining unity through shared values. By empowering members to act independently yet cohesively, bhū seeks to foster a global community that thrives on trust, collaboration, and mutual benefit, redefining how organizations can scale and impact without traditional structures
