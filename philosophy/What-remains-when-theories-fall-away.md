# What remains when theories fall away?

In his book do aliens speak physics physicist Daniel Whiteson asks thought provoking questions on the nature of reality and casts doubt on our current physical understanding of the universe. 

What if our theories don't describe true reality? This is an important question to ask and one that has been asked by many philosophers. It forms the basis of ontology a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of reality. 

It is true that scientific theories describe a subset of reality and it's difficult to apply them outside of their domain. Particles physics can't predict hurricanes yet. 

Aliens may choose different assumptions and come up with different theories. It would challenge our understanding of reality but won't change reality itself.  

From a philosophical point of view it might be helpful to remove the foundations upon which our theories rest and see what remains. If you can get rid of that too then it's not fundamental. If you can't then it is. 

Emergent systems create new rules and theories might not be good enough to make predictions scientifically but it should be possible to probe into the source from where these theories and laws emerge.  

Reality exists, our perception can't change it.
