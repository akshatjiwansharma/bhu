Carbon based conductor research selected for presentation at IMAT 2025

6 June 2025

Excited to share that my research paper 'Unlocking the Potential of Carbon for Long-Distance Electrical Transmission' has been accepted for oral presentation at the International Materials Applications & Technologies Conference and Exposition - IMAT (October 20-23, 2025) in Detroit, MI. 

I thank the IMAT committee for giving me the opportunity to share my views on carbon based conductors and the immense potential they hold in meeting the needs of power industry by providing a viable alternative to copper in HVDC transmission. It has been a focus area of research of many organizations and among those , the researchers at Bosch have made significant contribution to development of high conductivity carbon wires.  

I would also like to thank ASM international for providing a platform to material scientists from around the world to exchange ideas. Without their tireless behind the scenes work the community would be far more fragmented and unorganised. 

I look forward to interacting with other presenters in the coming months. The full paper can be accessed on this link
