Panel discussion —Future of Mobility Investments NSRCEL,IIM Banglore

14 Aug 2025

Happy to participate in the Future of Mobility Investments at IIT Delhi and learn about the perspective of investors & the thought process that goes into making investment decisions in technologies like electric vehicles.

Over the last decade EV tech has matured and has proven itself to be reliable and efficient. Challenges however remain with respect to battery materials (cobalt and lithium both are costly and rare while copper supply is increasingly being strained although it may yet prove to be resilient).

A more serious concern is that of long charging times associated with EV. Silicon based chargers have been pushed to their limits. Wide band gap semiconductors could replace them but rarity of Gallium and difficulty in scaling the leyly process for manufacturing of much more abundant Silicon carbide could present a tough barrier for engineers.

EV works but manufacturing vehicles and associated components leads to huge technical complexity (literally semiconductor grade manufacturing tech is required) making it difficult to replicate.

Investors look at the unit costs but unit costs often abstract away the tech debt that one has to undertake. Companies are not willing to share secrets of manufacturing some advanced components. Even though EVs may succeed in the market it would always be dependent on imported tech. Even if everything could be manufactured in house it would be difficult to control supply chain of rare earths in motors magnets and in batteries

Hydrogen on the other hand is far easier to produce using a well understood technology that can be used in a vehicle like familiar carbon based fuels ,completely sidestepping the requirement for electrification, charging technology and reliance on rare materials.

The only disadvantage to hydrogen production being the finite lifetime of electrodes that can be managed with existing tech. & solved with more research.

Alongside the push for EV investors need to stay in the loop of latest developments in the Hydrogen sector as it could prove itself to be a worthy contender — far more economical & environment friendly.
