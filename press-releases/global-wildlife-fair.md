# Global wildlife fair insights on conservation and justice

10 OCT 2025

This October the global wildlife fair brought together conservationists and travel enthusiasts together at the constitutional club of India.

It was a privilege for me to connect with people from around the world united for a single purpose â€” conservation of Nature.

As one of the most biodiverse countries on earth, Costa Rica took the center stage in promoting the role of ecotourism and spreading awareness about wildlife conservation that often seems to be forgotten during the excitement of travelling to a new destination.

The event presented an opportunity for me to understand some of the challenges that destinations like Mongolia, Uganda,Colombia ,Sri Lanka and Kenya face trying to stand out from overcrowded destinations in Asia ,EU and Americas.

Lack of direct flights,visa challenges and consumer awareness are key reasons why some nations struggle to attract visitors despite having beautiful landscapes.

While establishing direct air links may take significant time and resources, visa restrictions can be relaxed with policy level changes. A single visa for Africa and Americas would work wonders to improve footfall.

The organisation of American states and the African Union have the political strength to bring about this change. What they need is the willingness to act.

All of us felt deeply the loss of Jane Goodall. For several decades she was a guide to conservationists from around the world. The best way for us to honor her memory is to continue working to protect the rights of all living beings, especially animals who have suffered greatly in the last few centuries and paid the price for our progress.

In his highly influential work legal scholar John Chipman Gray insists that animals can have no legal rights because they are unable to perform duties. This is the view that many learned justices have taken.

This legal viewpoint however contradicts the fact,which Prof Gray also emphasises, that laws are derived from social customs and traditions. Many native communities in Asia ,Africa and LATAM have traditionally given importance to protection of nature. It's deeply unfortunate that when establishing laws both the policy makers and learned justices have chosen to ignore this simple truth.

Principles of natural justice demand that our laws be just for not only human beings but also for all of nature. Conservationists have tried hard to sensitise people about humane treatment of animals and of indigenous people with the hope that one day it will lead to change. Perhaps it will.
