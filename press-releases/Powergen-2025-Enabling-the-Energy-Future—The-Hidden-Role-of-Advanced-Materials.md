Powergen 2025 Enabling the Energy Future — The Hidden Role of Advanced Materials

Powergen 2025 brought together leading names in the industry —Rolls Royce, GE, Suzlon ,Imco alloys,Magaldi,Polycab,Hydrogen Association of India among others to strategize on how best to meet the power requirements of the future.
Energy is the most important sector one on which all other industries are dependent upon directly.

The panelists discussed challenges associated with Distribution and transmission of energy and dependence on copper. Creation of composites for wind turbines, especially the high cost of carbon fiber, was flagged as a concern.
Hydrogen storage and limited lifetime of electrodes necessitating stack replacement was also discussed.

These are challenging problems that have no straightforward answers. While for AC electrical transmission the dependence on metals would continue. But for HV low current transmission carbon based conductors could prove very useful.

Wind turbines are doing fine with glass fiber composites. Yet there are ways to make them cheaper with plant based carbon fibers created through molten salt synthesis and densified with hydrocarbons for improved strength, getting rid of expensive polyacrylonitrile based precursors.

Traditional internal combustion engines have carried the automotive industry for decades but revival of an older technology — Stirling engine could breathe a new life in the sector with its versatility. One engine that could double up as a refrigerator taking care of both mechanical work and cooling needs while working on diverse fuels from natural gas to hydrogen could prove to be transformative.

Carbon aluminosilicate composite high temperature materials are extremely promising for use in harsh oxidative environments reducing dependence on metals while delivering circularity and sustainability.

Thin glass substrates — a few hundred micrometers thick could revolutionize production of lenses and drive the change in solar energy storage systems. 

It is true that energy is the most important sector. But energy generation,transmission and distribution is out and out a material science problem. Innovations in material science are going to be vital to realise the dream of sustainable abundant energy. It is essential to recognise this and invest in research and development of the next generation of materials.The challenge is to recognise new possibilities that lay before us.
