# Strengthening Asia–Africa Tourism Corridors

It was a great honor for me to connect today with the Uganda High commission promoting Uganda as a travel destination to the Indian outbound market. With direct air flights to India and a single visa (the East African Tourist Visa) that unlocks access to Rwanda & Kenya , Uganda offers a compelling value proposition to Indian travellers. 

I had great fun discussing opportunities for expansion in Asian markets beyond India. Especially for wildlife enthusiasts (where Uganda shines) and for beach lovers ( where Kenya has some of the most stunning beaches that are slowly starting to offer luxury travel experiences) 

More African countries would benefit from a shenzhen-like single Visa system that would allow them to compete with the European market. Africa is definitely a destination for the more adventurous traveller. While Egypt, Tunisia & Morocco offer a rich history and Central Africa is famous for its safaris, coastal nations could become paradise for beach lovers. Tourism has the potential to transform the African economy. The African Union must work urgently towards socio-political unification of the continent to capture this opportunity. I look forward to future engagements with African delegates to strengthen Asia-Africa relations.
