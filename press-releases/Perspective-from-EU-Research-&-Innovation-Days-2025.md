Perspective from EU Research & Innovation (R&I) Days 2025

I thank the European Commission for organising European Research & Innovation (R&I) Days 2025 and giving me a chance to participate in the event discussing the future of European research.

Europe has had a long and storied tradition of science with philosophers like Locke,Hobbes,Descartes,Spinoza laying the groundwork for a scientific revolution producing the finest scientists who pushed the boundaries of human knowledge ,ushered the industrial revolution and birthed the modern world.

Yet today the EU finds itself at crossroads struggling to retain talent and capitalise on its inventions. Horizon Europe defines key enabling technologies that could propel the EU far ahead of its competitors.

Past Records show that Europe has the capability to do it. Its achievements in electronics,semiconductors,wind energy and development of advanced composites like GLARE are a testament to its enterprising citizens.

Europe has made strong contributions in open source software and while some of the speakers shared concerns about EUs dependence on proprietary US software there is no reason why it can't make the switch.

The key challenge the EU faces is not technical rather political. Member states pursue their own agendas and EU lacks unity to present a strong challenge to either Asian or American competitors. 

Furthermore the research institutions and industries are highly concentrated in west EU while the east lags behind.

The EU chips act was legislated as a response to the American chips act. Several policies have been a reaction to American moves. The EU can't afford to be reactive.

President Leyen's call for independence and  sovereignty has been inspiring. She has been a star performer securing deals in LATAM ,Central Asia,China, India and outlining a Mattei Plan for collaboration with Africa and even managing to hold out against President Trump while dealing with a war and surviving no confidence vote. The EU could not have asked for a better leader in these times.

It will be challenging for president Leyen— to push for the new while trying to keep the union together.

German American Nobel laureate Herbert Kroemer remarked " The principal applications of any sufficiently new and innovative technology always have been – and will continue to be - applications created by that technology." By embracing research the EU can do much more than simple iterative development. The EU can set the direction for everyone else to follow.
