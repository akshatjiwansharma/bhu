# My thoughts on IAEA and DOE talks on Fusion challenges:  Why Fusion matters even without net energy

11 Dec 2025

I thank the International Atomic Energy Agency and the US Department of Energy for organising public talks[1-2] on the challenges facing fusion and what the scientific community is doing to overcome them. 

Tritium availability, with total global reserves estimated to be only about 25-30kg [6], is one of the most pressing issues. If fusion is to be self-sustaining then techniques would have to be developed to generate enough tritium that could enable fusion to work. Researchers have identified neutron activation of Lithium as the most promising route but breeding it at a kg scale is no easy task. 

Li is a scarce resource[7-8]. Breeder reactors need a special radioactive isotope which is found in even lesser quantities (estimates suggest 7% of total Li). For viable tritium production it's estimated that a fusion reactor would need tens of tonnes of Li6. Consumption ~ 50 kg per year [9-11]. The energy generated would justify high usage, if challenges associated with breeder designs are overcome. 

Fusion tech could have more than one application even when not used as an energy generator —there are already several alternatives available for clean energy generation. 

Inertial electrostatic confinement fusion devices are essentially portable particle accelerators that are a rich source of neutrons which can be used for creating radioactive isotopes[13] having applications in the medical industry. These devices are known to be intense x-ray emitters,opening up possibilities in x-ray imaging.  

Non-fusing plasmas generated inside compact accelerators like IEC could be immensely useful as an ion source with ion temperatures easily reaching million K enabling materials processing. 

Possibilities exist to combine IEC tech with high frequency RF to turn them into high energy particle accelerators creating fusion free neutrons source via ion spallation of iron/lead.

This is why fusion tech ,especially electrostatic, holds promise even when it generates no useful power.

The US Department of energy has designated nuclear fusion as a lighthouse project under its genesis mission[3-5] which aims to develop breakthrough scientific technologies that sound audacious today. I support this decision and  hope that research continues to advance in this field.
