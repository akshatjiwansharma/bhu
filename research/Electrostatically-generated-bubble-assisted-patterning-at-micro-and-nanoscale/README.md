Electrostatically generated bubble assisted patterning at micro and nanoscale

ABSTRACT

Surface patterning at the micro and nanoscale is critical in areas like microelectronics, photonics, biosensing, and materials science. A variety of techniques have been developed to produce these patterns. The majority of these techniques are lithographic; they transfer patterns on a substrate making them highly sophisticated and complex, but inflexible. Machines are locked into a pattern size and are unable to deviate from the parameters they have been designed with. 

Here we investigate if bubbles,which have long been known to cause surface pitting on metals ,ceramics and polymers, can be used to carefully and precisely pattern a substrate on nano and microscale. 

Electrostatic nucleation and detonation of bubbles is evaluated as a possible technique that can satisfy stringent requirements of nucleating and collapsing nanosized bubbles. Bubble size can be modulated through electric fields giving this technique flexibility in engraving features,in a range of sizes, on a substrate that is not possible in other lithographic methods. 

If successful, bubble based nano patterning could open up new cost effective routes for the production of nano confined plasmas, display panels, plasma electrolysis for hydrogen production and plasma based integrated circuits for computation.
