# Bamboo doesn't work with concrete could mechanically stabilized earth be used for midrises? 

Construction industry has been trying to decarbonise but what materials can actually help it do that? It's a tough question. 

Both concrete and steel almost seem indispensable. 

Replacing steel is incredibly difficult in the construction industry.Some efforts have been made in substituting bamboo for steel.  Bamboo seems to offer a solution but bonding with concrete is a concern as many studies show & its true that hurdles remain even after a good bonding is achieved.

But alternatives exist. One such proven technology is Mechanically stabalised earth in which soil is stabalised with horizontal grids to improve it's shear strength through friction. 

Soil already has excellent compressive strength and by minimising its failure in shear it can be and has been used in pillars and other load bearing components. So carbonised plant based materials(meshes) can be used in making concrete free structures like 10 story mid rises. 

Here's a study that uses MSE for bridge abutments.

Where else can this idea be applied? Are there any other application of sand composites that might help in creating sustainable structures? How about wind turbine pillars?
