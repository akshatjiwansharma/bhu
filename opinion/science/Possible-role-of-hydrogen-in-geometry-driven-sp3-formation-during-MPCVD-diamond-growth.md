# Possible role of hydrogen in geometry-driven sp3 formation during MPCVD diamond growth

There is ongoing debate about the exact mechanisms that cause diamond formation in the microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) process.

While it’s well established that methane (CH4) and hydrogen (H2)are the key gases Hydrogen etches away non-diamond (sp2) carbon, while carbon from CH₄ contributes to diamond (sp3) growth. 

Yet the exact carbon-containing species responsible for diamond growth ,whether CH3 radicals, C2 dimers, or other species are the dominant contributors are not known.

It's also not clear what surface reactions and growth mechanisms contribute to growth and how these species attach to diamond surfaces and stabilize sp3 bonds.
  
While the general scheme is agreed upon, the precise atomic and plasma-chemical pathways that make diamond grow in MPCVD[2] are still a topic of active research and debate.

Here's what I think happens Hydrogenation of carbon structures adds H atoms to carbon.This process promotes sp3 hybridization in formerly sp2 ,sp carbons. As a result, bond angles shift toward the tetrahedral 109.5°, both for C–C–C and H–C–H angles.

This is clear if we study the bond angles of single bonded carbon species like CH4,C2H6 vs graphite and  C2H2.
When these molecules decompose on the heated substrate, diamonds start growing by addition of pre sp3 hybridised carbon atoms. 


A key insight can be obtained from Diamond like carbon films which are grown at a much lower temperature. These films contain both sp2 and sp3 hybridised carbon. But while films that are grown in hydrogen atmosphere are generally transparent, the films grown without hydrogen are darker in color. Indicating that hydrogen atoms change the bond angles towards sp3 hybridisation. Structurally these films could be simillar to perhydrogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. 

This is why atomic hydrogen is necessary during film growth that require transparency [1]. 

The shift is not just about stabilizing dangling bonds it physically changes the geometry of the carbon network. 
Hydrogenation does not generally break single C-C bonds; it mainly converts double/triple bonds to single bonds .

Ref #2 is important because it establishes you don't need a diamond substrate to grow diamonds. A diamond-like substrate eg SiC would work as well.
